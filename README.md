# Morra Game

Welcome to the **Morra Game**, a Python implementation of the classic game of strategy and chance. This project was developed as part of our Year 1 Software Development coursework by Fiona Odige and Esiyemeh Idogho. The game is designed to showcase our programming skills and teamwork in solving real-world challenges.

## About the Game

The Morra Game is a simple yet engaging two-player game (Player vs. Computer). In each round, both players simultaneously show between 1 and 10 fingers. The winner is determined based on the total number of fingers shown:
- If the total is **even**, the player who chose "Even" wins.
- If the total is **odd**, the player who chose "Odd" wins.

The winner of the round earns **2 points**, and an additional **1 point** is awarded to the player whose number of fingers is closer to the total. The game continues until one player accumulates **6 points**, at which point they are declared the winner.

   - Start a new game.
   - Check current scores and rounds.
   - Exit the game.

2. **Scoring System**:
   - Points are awarded based on game outcomes and proximity to the total fingers.
   - Tracks rounds and resets scores after each game.

3. **Player Interaction**:
   - Choose between "Even" or "Odd".
   - Input the number of fingers (1-10) to play each round.

## Development Process

The development of this game was a learning experience from start to finish. As a team, Fiona and I began by carefully analyzing the assignment brief and brainstorming how to structure the project. Here's how we approached it:

### 1. **Planning**
- **Pseudocode**: Writing pseudocode helped us outline the gameâ€™s logic, such as global variables, menu options, and game outcomes.
- **Flowchart**: Using Miro, we designed a flowchart to visualize the game's structure and logic. This step was challenging but invaluable for understanding the overall workflow.

### 2. **Coding**
Starting with basic functionality, we gradually built the program using:
- **Global Variables** to track player and computer scores.
- **Functions** for the menu, gameplay, and rule display.
- **Control Structures** (loops, conditionals) to manage user input and game logic.

### 3. **Testing**
We rigorously tested the game to ensure it worked as intended:
- Menu navigation (rules, play, scores, exit).
- Handling invalid inputs gracefully.
- Correct calculation of scores and winner declaration.
